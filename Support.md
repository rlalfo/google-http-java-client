## File Feature Requests and Defects ##

You can suggest features and report issues on our public [Issue Tracker](https://code.google.com/p/google-http-java-client/issues/list). This is a great place for the community to discuss and track implementations of features or resolution of bug fixes, as well as share workarounds and patches.

If you find a bug:
  * View [known bugs](http://code.google.com/p/google-http-java-client/issues/list?can=2&q=Type%3DDefect&sort=priority&colspec=ID+Milestone+Summary), and if a known bug corresponds to the issue you are seeing, "star" it or comment on it.
  * If the issue you are seeing has not yet been reported,  [file a bug report](http://code.google.com/p/google-http-java-client/issues/entry).

If you have a feature request:
  * View [existing feature requests](http://code.google.com/p/google-http-java-client/issues/list?can=2&q=type%3DEnhancement&sort=milestone+priority&colspec=ID+Milestone+Summary), and if a requested feature corresponds to a feature you would like, "star" it or comment on it .
  * If the feature has not yet been requested, [file a feature request](http://code.google.com/p/google-http-java-client/issues/entry?template=Request%20a%20Feature).

If you have a sample request:
  * View existing [sample requests](http://code.google.com/p/google-http-java-client/issues/list?can=2&q=type%3DSample&sort=priority&colspec=ID+Priority+Summary), and if a requested sample corresponds to a sample you would like, "star" it or comment on it.
  * If the sample has not been requested, [file a sample request](http://code.google.com/p/google-http-java-client/issues/entry?template=Request%20a%20Sample).
